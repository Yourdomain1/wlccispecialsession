        <h1>Ethical and Explainable Computational Intelligence in Medical and Health Systems</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;">A Special Session at the IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI) 2026</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The widespread adoption of computational intelligence systems, including neural networks, fuzzy systems, and advanced learning algorithms, in critical healthcare applications necessitates a rigorous focus on their responsible and trustworthy development. This special session will serve as an interdisciplinary forum to explore the challenges and opportunities at the intersection of computational intelligence and healthcare systems. Building on the core expertise of the organizers in deep learning for medical image analysis, privacy-preserving techniques, robust fuzzy systems, wearable devices, and AI ethics, this session will bridge foundational research with its real-world ethical, legal, and social implications.</p>
            <p>We will welcome contributions that address how to build robust and fair AI systems for clinical diagnostics, ensure data privacy through federated and blockchain-based learning, enhance model interpretability, and design intelligent wearable/implantable devices. The session's topics are directly relevant to IJCNN, FUZZ-IEEE, and IEEE CEC, as they involve fundamental challenges in algorithmic fairness, explainability, and the application of advanced computational paradigms to sensitive data. The potential impact is to foster collaborations among AI researchers, medical professionals, and ethicists, accelerating the development of a new generation of healthcare AI that is not only effective but also ethically sound and transparent.</p>
